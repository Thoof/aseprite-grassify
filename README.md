A small aseprite script that converts the current layer/selection to a grasslike texture. Mostly works on single, isolated colors.

HOW TO USE

    In aseprite, go File->Scripts->Open scripts folder
    Download the zip file. Put CustomBrushOptions.lua into the scripts folder.
    File->Scripts->Rescan scripts folder
    File->Scripts->CustomBrushOptions
    Should be good to go! 
    
Grass coverage: The amount of grass that appears along the edge of a pixel cluster
